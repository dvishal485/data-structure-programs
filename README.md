# Assignment Questions

1. [Given the head of a linked list and an integer n, write a program to delete nth
node from the end of linked list and return the head of new list.](./programs/assignments/assignment_01.c)
1. [We have discussed the problem of implementing Queue using two stacks using an
approach where the enqueue operation is constant time while dequeue operation
takes O(n) time. Think about a different approach of implementing queue using
two stacks where enqueue operation may be costly but the dequeue operation
remains O(1). Write the enqueue and dequeue operations code for this new
approach.](./programs/assignments/assignment_02.c)
1. [Given a linked list, write a program to swap every two adjacent nodes and return
its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the linked
list nodes. For a linked list with odd number of nodes, last node should not be
swapped.](./programs/assignments/assignment_03.c)
